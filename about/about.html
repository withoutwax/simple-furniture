                  <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
                  <p>Simple Furniture is a web-based format that invites users to interact with the site, and get results in real time. It provides users with a live image simulation of each assembly step in great detail to better help them comprehend the steps while they are  simultaneously assembling their furniture. By transforming a complex, stressful process to an interactive, entertaining one, the users can instead feel a sense of achievement, rather than frustration, when they finish assembling their furniture.</p>

                  <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
                  <p>Self-assembling furniture is not only efficient and affordable, but also a trendy way to decorate houses. Although these types of furniture are commonly used due to these previously mentioned advantages, there are still very clear disadvantages why people can be reluctant to buy self-assembly furniture, one of the reasons being the complication and frustration of the assembly steps. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Although furniture companies provide instructions, they are not real photos, but simple illustrations, which does not effectively convey all the assembly steps clearly.
